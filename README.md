# üéØ QuizApp

QuizApp is a ReactJS-based web application that allows users to take assessments by solving multiple-choice questions (MCQs). The application ensures a seamless user experience with validations, scoring, and a final result display.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive Quiz**: Users can solve MCQs one question at a time.
- **Option Selection Validation**: Users cannot proceed to the next question without selecting an option.
- **Dynamic Scoring**: Scores are calculated in real-time using a `score` state variable.
- **Final Score Display**: Once all questions are answered, users are presented with their final score.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The application provides a smooth and intuitive interface for taking quizzes.

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Start the Quiz**:
   - The quiz begins with the first question displayed on the screen.
   
2. **Option Selection**:
   - Users must select an option to enable the "Next" button.
   - If no option is selected, the user cannot proceed to the next question.

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - The score is updated dynamically based on the correctness of the selected options.

4. **Final Score**:
   - Once the user completes all questions, the application displays the final score out of the total number of questions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **State Management**: Managed using React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.

## üìã How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/quizapp.git
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
